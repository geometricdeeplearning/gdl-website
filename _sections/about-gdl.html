<!-- <p>In the last decade, Deep Learning approaches (e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) allowed to achieve unprecedented performance on a broad range of problems coming from a variety of different fields (e.g. Computer Vision and Speech Recognition). Despite the results obtained, research on DL techniques has mainly focused so far on data defined on Euclidean domains (i.e. grids). Nonetheless, in a multitude of different fields, such as: Biology, Physics, Network Science, Recommender Systems and Computer Graphics; one may have to deal with data defined on non-Euclidean domains (i.e. graphs and manifolds), which generally has a structure and symmetries different from Euclidean data.. The adoption of Deep Learning in these particular fields has been lagging behind until very recently, primarily since the non-Euclidean nature of data makes the definition of basic operations (such as convolution) rather elusive. Geometric Deep Learning deals in this sense with the extension of Deep Learning techniques to graph/manifold structured data.</p>

<p>This website represents a collection of materials in the field of Geometric Deep Learning. We collect workshops, tutorials, publications and code, that several differet researchers has produced in the last years. Our goal is to provide a general picture of this new and emerging field, which is rapidly developing in the scientific community, thanks to the broad applicability it presents.</p> -->

<p>Deep Learning has profoundly impacted machine learning and the way we think about solving problems in a wide range of fields, such as computer vision, and speech recognition. The classical assumption of deep learning models is that the geometry of the data is Euclidean. As a consequence, important applications that involve non-Euclidean data, such as graphs and manifolds, have remained out of reach. Geometric Deep Learning is an emerging field that aims to break free of the Euclidean assumption.</p>
<p>Research in geometric deep learning spans from the redefinition of basic deep learning operations (such as convolutions) to enable architectures that exploit the different structure and symmetries of non-Euclidean data, to the geometry of embeddings, and the application geometric deep learning methods to fields such as biology, physics, network science, recommender systems, or computer graphics and 3D vision.</p>
<p>This website is a hub for the geometric deep learning community, to centralize and promote resources (publications, code), and events (workshops, tutorials) around GDL.</p>
